# Data-Visulaization-BI

This dashboard is visualizing COVID-19 world vaccination progress. It utilizes daily and total Vaccination for COVID-19 in the world. Data is collected daily from ourworldindata.org in Data GitHub repository for covid-19, merged and uploaded. Then, taken from Kaggle. Currently, I cleaned and filtered data to make dataset limited in some countries around the world.
Furthermore, you can filter dashboard by country and\or time duration to figure out vaccination progress.
